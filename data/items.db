You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. <br /><br />While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p><ul><li>Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Willpower, and Personality scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has an legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.</li><li>When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.</li><li>You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your breast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you've already cast.</li><li>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li><li>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it.

With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 200 septims worth of rare herbs and fine food, you call forth an animal from the wilderness to serve as your faithful companion from any beast with a CR of ½ or lower, such as an ape, a black bear, a boar, a giant badger, a giant weasel, a mule, a panther, or a wolf. However, your GM might pick one of these animals for you, based on the surrounding terrain and on what types of creatures would be logically present in the area. <br /><br />At the end of 8 hours, your animal companion appears and gains all the benefits of your Companion's Bond ability. You can have only one animal companion at a time. <br /><br />If your animal companion is ever slain, the magical bond you share allows you to return it to life. With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 100 septims worth of rare herbs and fine food you call forth your companion's spirit and use your magic to create a new body for it. You can return an animal companion to life in this manner even if you do not possess any part of its body. <br /><br />If you use this ability to return a former animal companion to life while you have a current animal companion, your current companion leaves you and is replaced by the restored companion. <br /><br />If you gain a new animal companion at higher levels, you can choose from any beast with a CR as shown on the Beast Companions At Higher Levels table.</p><h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Companion.27s_Bond\">Companion's Bond</span></h3><p>Your animal companion gains a variety of benefits while it is linked to you. <br /><br />The animal companion loses it's Multiattack action, if it has one. <br /><br />The companion obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your companion acts on its own. <br /><br />Your animal companion has abilities and game statistics determined in part by your level. Your companion uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. In addition to areas where it normally uses its proficiency bonus to its AC and to its damage rolls. <br /><br />Your animal companions gain proficiency in two skills of your choice. It also becomes proficient with all saving throws. <br /><br />For each level you gain after 2nd, your animal companion gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly. <br /><br />Whenever you gain the Attribute Score Improvement class feature, your companion's attributes also improve. Your companion can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your companion can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies otherwise. <br /><br />Your companion shares your alignment, and has a personality trait and a flaw that you can roll for or select from the tables below.
